Do you even wonder how Math and Machine Learning could help you **save money in transportation** for your logistics operation?
If that's the case, I may have a solution for you!

This code design to create models and analyze the data in order to **predict transportation costs** based on certain parameters.

***This code uses Linear Regression, Decision Tree and Support Vector Regression.***

Here's a link to the notebook view with the code and full analysis of the data.
