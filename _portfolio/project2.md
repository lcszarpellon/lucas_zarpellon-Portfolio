Do you have some money saved and plan to buy a car but don't know which one to buy?
If that's the case, you're in luck, because today we're going to do some Exploratory Data Analysis in a Car Sales dataset from Kaggle, to understand which cars were sold the most from Jan 2022 until Dec 2023, so we can **decide the best car** in the market based on historical sales.

This code is designed to explore the ***seasonal componesnts*** of car sales in the US.

Here's a link to the notebook view with the code and full analysis of the data.
